Topic   : Token bucket rate limiter for API call throttling
Project : CW1 - Value + News Sentiment Strategy

Implements the Token Bucket algorithm for rate limiting API calls
to Yahoo Finance and GDELT. This is the industry-standard approach
used by cloud providers (AWS, GCP) and API gateways (Kong, Envoy).

Algorithm:
  - A bucket holds up to ``capacity`` tokens.
  - Tokens are added at a fixed ``rate`` per second.
  - Each API call consumes one token.
  - If no tokens are available, the caller blocks until
    sufficient tokens have been replenished.

Thread-safe: uses ``threading.Lock`` for concurrent workers.
Sleeps outside the lock to avoid blocking other threads.
